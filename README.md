<!-- Plugin description -->
[Brunch](https://brunch.io/), a fast front-end web application build tool, features a simple declarative configuration
and seamless incremental compilation for rapid development.

With the help of community-shared skeletons, this plugin streamlines the initialization process of a new project. Among
these, the renowned "ES6 skeleton" might appear intimidating at first glance, but it's exceptionally contemporary and
user-friendly. It's certainly worth giving a try for your new app!

Regardless of your proficiency level, whether you're a professional or a novice, this tool simplifies and accelerates
the setup and initialization phase of your project creation process.
